# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Objectives
The objective of this project is to develop a classification model that can efficiently detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The model aims to minimize false positives while ensuring high accuracy, making it suitable for real-world applications in the financial sector.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders, with a total of 284,807 transactions, of which only 492 are fraudulent.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the Main Script**: Execute the main script to train the model and evaluate its performance:
   ```bash
   python credit_card_fraud_detection.py

## Conclusion
In summary, this project not only highlights the effectiveness of machine learning in fraud detection but also emphasizes the importance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation in building reliable predictive models. The insights gained from this project can serve as a foundation for further research and development in the field of financial fraud detection, ultimately contributing to safer and more secure financial transactions.
